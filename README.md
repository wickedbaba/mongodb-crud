# CRUD operations in MongoDB

Basic operations in mongodbd, using Pymongo. I learnt all this from the [certification](https://github.com/wickedbaba/mongodb-crud/blob/main/wb-asr-mongodb-certificate.pdf) present on MongoDB's [official website](https://learn.mongodb.com/learn/learning-path/mongodb-python-developer-path)


I'll soon be uploading extra files with scenarios which depict real world implementations, for better understanding of mongodb operations
